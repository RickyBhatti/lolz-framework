# lolz-framework
A framework being designed for FiveM.

# Disclaimer
I have no clue if I'll end up finishing this framework. Hell, I don't even know what it's going to be designed to do. I just know I want to make a framework for FiveM for fun. Now, with that said, I'm not really "planning" this out. So, if you see "questionable" code, weird design choices, etc, it's probably because I just wrote it quickly and didn't think about it. If you want to contribute, feel free to open a PR or issue. If I do end up deciding to finish this, I'll actually refactor a lot of the code to be better and more efficient. Right now, this project is just whenever I get an urge to work on it and I slap random stuff in it.

## What is this?
As I mentioned above, it's going to hopefully be a completed framework for FiveM at some time. What specifically will the framework do? Not sure yet. I know I'm not designing it around the roleplay aspect, I want to make something modular, that you can work with to turn it into whatever. So, it'll be more like a core that has a bunch of utilities. Oh, so I guess this is the "lolz-core."

## Oh you're trying to replace X framework?
No, I really don't care to replace whatever framework you think I'm trying to replace. I'm just a developer who wants to make this for fun. If people end up using it, cool. If not, cool.
